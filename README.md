# Train-Jam

This game was made for the Train-Jam organized by the candidates of the CNAM ENJMIN. 

It is above all a personal challenge on my programming skills, so the gameplay and the graphic style are not the most worked.

The game is entierly developed in python using the pygame library


# Install instructions

You'll need a python interpreter and use the commands :

```py
pip install requirement.txt
```

and pass the `main.py` file in the interpretor by using :

```py
python main.py
```
